          Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, was an English mathematician and writer,
          chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical
          general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to
          recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation,
          and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a
          machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer
          programmer.

          Ada's notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first
          algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. She also introduced
          many computer science concepts such as looping and subroutines.
          Despite her groundbreaking contributions, her work was largely
          forgotten until the 1950s.

          Ada Lovelace's legacy continues to inspire women in STEM fields. She
          has been honored with Ada Lovelace Day, an annual event celebrating
          women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
